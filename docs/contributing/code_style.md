# Code Style (Release-facing)

This document captures release-facing language rules for the public repository.

## Language policy

- CLI help, error messages, and user-facing output must be English.
- Code comments in Rust and Clove sources must be English.
- Tests should use English comments and messages.
- Japanese documentation is allowed only in `*.ja.md` files.

## Rationale

- Public releases should be readable by a wider audience.
- Consistent language in code and CLI improves discoverability and support.
