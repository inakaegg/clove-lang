;; Basic OOP-style chaining
(let [xs (range 10)]
  (println "top3 descending =" xs.reverse.take(3)))

;; String-oriented chaining
(let [csv "a,b,c"]
  (println "reversed parts =" (str csv.string::split(",").reverse)))

;; Only functions with known subject-pos can be chained.
;; map/take/reverse/split/join are allowed. Custom functions should be (defn f [$coll] ...) or include {:subject-pos n}.
